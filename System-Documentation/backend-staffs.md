Based on the dashboard designs you've shared and your description of the system, the **TrackXpert Monitor** will be the central system managing all student and staff data, as well as actions related to RFID, NFC, QR codes, and the interactions with POS systems for various operations like student attendance, discipline monitoring, and kitchen services. Let’s break down the components you’ll need in terms of models, views, and APIs:

### Key Models for Your System

1. **Student Model**:
   - `student_id`: Unique identifier (linked to the card)
   - `name`
   - `class_level`
   - `date_of_birth`
   - `contact_info`
   - `registered_card_id`: Foreign key to the `Card` model
   - `discipline_points`: Tracks student's discipline record
   - `attendance_record`: Many-to-many field with `Attendance` model
   - `food_service_record`: Many-to-many field with `KitchenService` model

2. **Admin Model** (for system administrators):
   - `admin_id`
   - `username`
   - `password`
   - `role`: (e.g., System Admin, Kitchen Admin, Attendance Admin)

3. **Card Model** (for smart cards):
   - `card_id`: Unique identifier (could be linked with RFID, NFC, QR Code)
   - `issued_to`: Foreign key to `Student` model
   - `issue_date`
   - `expiry_date`
   - `active_status`

4. **POSModel** (this tracks the point of sale interactions, such as attendance checking at the gate):
   - `pos_id`
   - `location`: (e.g., Gate, Kitchen, Admin Desk)
   - `activity_type`: (Attendance, Food Service)
   - `timestamp`
   - `related_card`: Foreign key to the `Card` model

5. **Attendance Model**:
   - `attendance_id`
   - `student`: Foreign key to the `Student` model
   - `attendance_time`
   - `status`: (Present, Late, Absent)

6. **Discipline Model**:
   - `discipline_id`
   - `student`: Foreign key to `Student`
   - `incident_description`
   - `points_deducted`
   - `date_of_incident`

7. **KitchenService Model**:
   - `service_id`
   - `student`: Foreign key to the `Student` model
   - `food_item`
   - `service_time`

8. **Staff Attendance Model**:
   - `staff_id`
   - `attendance_date`
   - `status`: (Present, Late, Absent)
   - `timestamp`

- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/register-card**: Register a new card to a student or staff.
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/cards
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/register-student**: Register new student information (linked to a card).
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/attendance-check**: Check attendance using card ID at the gate.
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/discipline-incident**: Log discipline-related incidents for a student.
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/kitchen-service**: Record the food services for students using their card.
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/student/{id}/details**: Fetch student details (including attendance and discipline).
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/dashboard**: Fetch admin-specific data for monitoring.
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/POS-device**: To post to the pos manager
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/POS-device**: To get to the pos manager
- **POST /auth/admin/register**: to register the admin
- **GET /auth/admin/login**: This is to logged in the admin to the system
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/**: To get the admin's and to monitor them accordingly 
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/student**: To get the individual student information based on the card Id 
- **etc....**: for the others you think

### The status codes that is needed

### 1. Informational
These codes indicate that the request was received and understood, and the process is continuing.

- **100 Continue**: The initial part of a request has been received, and the client should continue with the request.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server agrees to switch to a different protocol (for example, from HTTP to WebSocket).

### 2. Success
These codes indicate that the server successfully processed the request.

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource or processed it correctly.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created (typically returned after a `POST` request, like creating a new user or adding a new item).
- **202 Accepted**: The request has been accepted for processing, but it is not yet completed. This is often used for asynchronous processing.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to return (commonly used when updating or deleting resources).
  
### 3. Redirection
These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request (usually the client is redirected to another URL).

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found (or Temporarily Moved)**: The requested resource is temporarily available at a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request, so the client can use its cached version.

### 4. Client Errors
These codes indicate that there was an error with the client's request (such as incorrect input or unauthorized access).

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand or process the request due to invalid syntax or missing parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required, and the client has not provided valid credentials (often returned when authentication fails).
- **403 Forbidden**: The client does not have permission to access the resource, even if they are authenticated.
- **404 Not Found**: The server could not find the requested resource. This usually occurs when a URL is incorrect or the resource does not exist.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: The HTTP method used in the request is not allowed for the resource (for example, sending a `GET` request to a resource that only accepts `POST`).
- **409 Conflict**: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource (commonly returned for conflicting updates).
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The client has made too many requests in a short amount of time (rate-limiting or throttling).

### 5. Server Errors
These codes indicate that the server encountered an error or is unable to fulfill the request.

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition that prevents it from fulfilling the request.
- **501 Not Implemented**: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overload or scheduled maintenance.
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server, acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

### Common API Status Codes in Use:

1. **200 OK**: 
   - Used when retrieving data successfully (GET requests).
   - Example: Retrieving user data or fetching a list of products.

2. **201 Created**: 
   - Used when successfully creating a resource (POST requests).
   - Example: Creating a new user account or adding a new item to an inventory.

3. **400 Bad Request**: 
   - When the client sends an invalid request.
   - Example: Missing or incorrect parameters in a form submission.

4. **401 Unauthorized**: 
   - When the client needs to authenticate to access a resource.
   - Example: Trying to access a protected API without a valid access token.

5. **403 Forbidden**: 
   - When the client is authenticated but doesn’t have permission to perform the action.
   - Example: A regular user trying to access admin-level resources.

6. **404 Not Found**: 
   - When the requested resource doesn’t exist.
   - Example: Accessing an incorrect URL for a specific product.

7. **500 Internal Server Error**: 
   - A generic error for any unexpected issue on the server side.
   - Example: An exception occurring in the server code.

8. **429 Too Many Requests**: 
   - When the client exceeds the rate limit of API calls in a given time period.
   - Example: A client hitting the API repeatedly and getting rate-limited.

### Data Flow between POS and Central System
- When a student taps their smart card at the gate (POS device), the **POS** will capture the card details and send this data to the **TrackXpert Monitor** system in real-time (or near real-time).
- The central system will process the data and update the appropriate records (e.g., marking the student as present, logging the transaction, etc.).
- The data can be transferred via APIs or using protocols like MQTT (for IoT-like POS systems), or WebSockets if you need real-time updates on the dashboard.

### Add-Ons and Future Features
- **Notifications**: Send notifications to parents/staff based on student activity (e.g., entering the gate, disciplinary actions).
- **RFID/NFC Management**: Tools to manage cards, activate/deactivate them remotely.
- **Reports**: Generate monthly/weekly reports on student attendance, discipline records, and food services usage.
