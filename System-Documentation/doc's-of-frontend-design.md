Based on the dashboard designs you've shared and your description of the system, the **TrackXpert Monitor** will be the central system managing all student and staff data, as well as actions related to RFID, NFC, QR codes, and the interactions with POS systems for various operations like student attendance, discipline monitoring, and kitchen services. Let’s break down the components you’ll need in terms of models, views, and APIs:
### API Endpoints
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/register-card**: Register a new card to a student or staff.
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/cards
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/register-student**: Register new student information (linked to a card).
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/attendance-check**: Check attendance using card ID at the gate.
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/discipline-incident**: Log discipline-related incidents for a student.
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/kitchen-service**: Record the food services for students using their card.
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/student/{id}/details**: Fetch student details (including attendance and discipline).
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/dashboard**: Fetch admin-specific data for monitoring.
- **POST /auth/admin/{id}/POS-device**: To post to the pos manager
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/POS-device**: To get to the pos manager
- **POST /auth/admin/register**: to register the admin
- **GET /auth/admin/login**: This is to logged in the admin to the system
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/**: To get the admin's and to monitor them accordingly 
- **GET /auth/admin/{id}/student**: To get the individual student information based on the card Id 
- **etc....**: for the others you think 

### Dashboard Functionality (TrackXpert Monitor)
Here’s what will be included in the **TrackXpert Monitor** based on the designs you've shown:
1. **Dashboard**; the landing page that have the general overview about the entire system
2. **Attendance Overview**: Real-time tracking of who enters the gate, possibly displaying:
   - Students present
   - Late students
   - Absent students
   - Filter options (daily, weekly, monthly attendance)

2. **Student Information Management**: A dashboard to:
   - Register and manage student details
   - Assign and manage cards (RFID, NFC, QR)
   - View the student’s attendance and discipline records

3. **Discipline Tracking**: Admin view to:
   - View students with disciplinary incidents
   - Manage and log discipline points and incidents

4. **Food Services**: Data showing students using their cards to get meals, broken down by time and type of service:
   - Track who is being served in the kitchen.
   - View food consumption patterns.

5. **POS Management**: Admin view for connected POS devices at various points (gates, kitchen, etc.):
   - Monitor which POS device is currently active.
   - View logs of all interactions through POS.

6. **Staff Attendance**: Overview of staff attendance data:
   - Track which staff members have clocked in.
   - Manage staff attendance records.

### Data Flow between POS and Central System
- When a student taps their smart card at the gate (POS device), the **POS** will capture the card details and send this data to the **TrackXpert Monitor** system in real-time (or near real-time).
- The central system will process the data and update the appropriate records (e.g., marking the student as present, logging the transaction, etc.).
- The data can be transferred via APIs or using protocols like MQTT (for IoT-like POS systems), or WebSockets if you need real-time updates on the dashboard.

### Add-Ons and Future Features
- **Notifications**: Send notifications to parents/staff based on student activity (e.g., entering the gate, disciplinary actions).
- **RFID/NFC Management**: Tools to manage cards, activate/deactivate them remotely.
- **Reports**: Generate monthly/weekly reports on student attendance, discipline records, and food services usage.
